    <h1 class="mt-16 text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is the Document Object Model (DOM)?</h1>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web pages. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects, where each element (like a heading, paragraph, or image) is a node. This allows developers to access, modify, or update the content, structure, and style of a webpage using languages like JavaScript.</p>
    <h1 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How do you select an element from the DOM?</h1>
    <p>To select an element from the DOM, we can use methods like- "getElementById('id')", "getElementsByClassName('class')", "getElementsByTagName('tag')" and many more</p>
    <h1 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is event delegation in the context of the DOM, and why is it useful?</h1>
    <p>
        Event delegation is a technique in the DOM where a single event listener is added to a parent element instead of multiple child elements. It takes advantage of event bubbling, where events triggered on child elements "bubble up" to their parent elements.
        <br><br>
        <b>Why it's useful:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency: Instead of adding an event listener to each child element, you can manage events from the parent, reducing the number of event listeners.</li>
            <br><li>Dynamic elements: It works well with elements added dynamically to the page, as the parent can handle events for new child elements without needing additional listeners.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1 class="mt-4 text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How do you manipulate an element's attributes and styles using the DOM?</h1>
    <p>To manipulate an element's attributes in the DOM, you can get or set attributes like <I>id, src, or href</I> using methods such as `getAttribute` or `setAttribute`. You can also remove attributes with `removeAttribute`.
        <br><br>
        For styles, you can directly modify the `style` property of an element to change things like its color, background, or size. Additionally, classes can be managed with `classList`, where you can add, remove, or toggle CSS classes to control the element's appearance. 
        <br><br>
        These techniques allow you to dynamically change the design and behavior of elements on your website.</p>
